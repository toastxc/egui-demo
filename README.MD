## EGUI Demo
This is a simple example of how I use Egui with a HTTP library and tokio


### main.rs
this file contains the program struct, its fields as well as the default constructor

### process.rs
This is where asyncrinous threads are spawned and other logical processing happens

### view.rs
This is the main ui layout
